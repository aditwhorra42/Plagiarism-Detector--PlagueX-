To understand good and evil, it is first important to understand Dharma. Dharma is one’s responsibility as part of one’s role in the society. No action is absolutely good or bad. The motive behind the action is more important than the action itself. When a murderer murders someone, he/she is penalized. Whereas, when a soldier kills someone while defending the country, it is considered to be a part of their Dharma. Therefore, Dharma also applies in some context. Dharma cannot be generalized as it varies from person to person and situation to situation.
