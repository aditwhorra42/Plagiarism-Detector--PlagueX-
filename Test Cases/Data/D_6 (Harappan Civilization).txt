Trade was also a very significant urban feature of this civilization. The Harappan trade networks were very extensive. This was a time before the initiation of coinage therefore the trade was based on barter. Trading in the Harappan civilization was of two kinds – short-distance and long-distance. Two-wheeled carts and animals played an important role in short-distance transportation of goods from one place to another. Although no carts have been discovered, their tracks along with small terracotta models of these carts have been found at numerous sites. Traders transported their merchandise in caravans driven by pack animals like oxen, sheep, goats and donkeys. The Harappans got their raw materials for production of goods from various parts of India. The limestone hills of Sukkur and Rohri were linked with the Harappan sites in Sindh, copper, lead and zinc came from Rajasthan and gold came from the Kolar fields of Karnataka.
