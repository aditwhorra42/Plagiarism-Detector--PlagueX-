With a market of $7.2 billion and 2 hotel rooms per 10,000 people, a new entrant has ample opportunity to disrupt the Indian budget hotel industry. By following the same strategy used by Ritesh, disruption of this market is achievable. He/She needs to first understand the main problems faced by customers of OYO to then start working on a solution. Next, he/she needs to utilise the latest technology at his/her disposal to attract a larger number of customers. Technology played one of the, if not the, most important parts in OYO’s success. It was by the use of “unique technology that OYO brought unorganised hotels onto its platform and made them easily discoverable”. With ICRA’s estimation of the growth of the online hotel booking industry from $800 million to $1.8 billion by the end of 2016, technology is key to progressing in this industry. Since the development of new technology has grown exponentially in recent years, disruption of the previous technology can take place at ant point in time.
