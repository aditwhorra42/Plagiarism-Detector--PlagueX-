Akbar was keen to know the principles and doctrines of all religion, historical material and contemporary records of Akbar’s reign make that clear. Throughout his stay in Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar engaged in an organised study and discussion of comparative theology and religion. Thus, the environment that Akbar was brought up in influenced his religious views in the direction of liberalism and promoted tolerance for all religions. He then started his personal inquiry into religion which grew out of his own disquiet and ongoing spiritual quest. Clearly interested in religious issues, Akbar started to invite scholars to court to discuss religious and theological topics. Initially, only Muslims took part, but later Akbar invited Jews, Zoroastrians, Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Christians. At his new capital, he built the ibadat-khana (house of worship) to accommodate scholarly exchanges. Through a series of bitter disputes with the ulema (a body of muslim scholars who have specialist knowledge on Islamic theology) at the Mughal court, Akbar was noticeably commiserating to the Christian point of view and impatient with the Muslim theologians’ inability to argue effectively against them. As the inquiries proceeded, Akbar progressively seemed to have become less enchanted with orthodox Islam and its defenders.
