According to Jackson, Mary already possessed all obtainable physical information about the visual experience of colors before she left the black and white room. However, upon leaving the room, she gained information which could not have been deduced by the physical truth alone. Therefore, Jackson shows that everything cannot be explained purely in physical terms and hence proves that physicalism is false. However, as will be shown in the following section of the paper, Jackson’s assumption that Mary gains new information about our visual experience of the world is flawed. Hence, physicalism will still hold true as Mary would not have learned anything new upon leaving the room.
