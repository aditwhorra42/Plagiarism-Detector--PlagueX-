Often, a dog will chase an animal with the focus of a heat-seeking missile. But a wheelbarrow planter was not part of Belgian sheepdog Rider’s focus. Rider collided with the wheelbarrow while the squirrel escaped up a cedar tree in Joyce Biethan’s backyard. “He’s kind of an all-or-nothing dog and he went into ‘all,'” Biethan said. “He chased after that squirrel with total disregard of what might be in front of him.” His collision left Rider with a broken scapula, a broken rib and a punctured lung. “He was in so much pain that I think he just tried to lay low,” Biethan said. “He prescribed himself bedrest.” Biethan said Rider did not need surgery and made a full recovery.
