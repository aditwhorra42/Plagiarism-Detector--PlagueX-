In Ancient Greece, Homer (800 BC) who at his time was considered to be the first and greatest of the epic poets, wrote the epic poems Iliad and the Odyssey. In these accounts he wrote about the journey of King Odyssey/Odysseus back home after the Trojan war. He emphasised aspects of war in his writings. Additionally he also wrote about godly interventions and glorified the events that took place during the war. Homer was catering to the aristocratic taste of his time which is why his writings acquired popularity. He was deified not as a god but as larger than life by the Ancient Greeks. However, Homers way of imagination (glorifying the past) gave way to newer ways of thinking. A few hundred years later, around 5th century BC Herodotus and Thucydides in their accounts of historical writing had a very different representation as compared to Homer’s. Herodotus wrote about the Persian invasion of Greece and unlike homer the shift that is seen in Herodotus’ writings are the exclusion of godly interventions. The emphasis here is on  extraordinary people such as King Leonidas and Themistocles. For him the war was an unfolding of Human destiny which is to say that humans fought and died they did not come across any gods. Furthermore, Thucydides also debunked the idea of godly interventions but he had a different way of writing. Herodotus wrote about cultures and civilisations whereas Thucydides was single-mindedly devoted to the Peloponnesian war. Thucydides was trying hard to write about evidence and proof which is why it his work was very difficult to read and understand as it was only based on facts and not aspects of a story.
