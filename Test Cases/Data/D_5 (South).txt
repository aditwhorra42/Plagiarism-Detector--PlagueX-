In the modern, ever-changing India it is very important to hold on to the cultural and religious beliefs that are so deeply rooted in this country’s history. At the same time, it is also important to keep evolving and developing as a country. These two dance forms, although very similar in practice, hold completely different meanings. Bharatanatyam keeps India embedded in its tradition and culture while Kuchipudi shows the progress that India has made in terms of its thinking and its beliefs. Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi together, through their different impacts on the Modern Indian society, maintain a perfect balance between traditionalism and modernity.
