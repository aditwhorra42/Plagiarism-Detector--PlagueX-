Gandhi talks about the rich cultural diversity of India and how many people with different religious beliefs have lived together and shared the same history. He views unity and cultural diversity as characteristics of a great civilization and thus, puts religious and cultural beliefs on a platform higher than the money making quality of capitalism. Contrasting these ideals to those of the modern civilization, capitalism divides the country as it creates competition and violence. Thus, Gandhi believes that India should not propagate the idea of capitalism as it is against his idea of an independent India.

Contrast the condition into which all these friendly Indians are suddenly plunged now, with their condition only two years previous: martial law now in force on all their reservations; themselves in danger of starvation, and constantly exposed to the influence of emissaries from their friends and relations, urging them to join in fighting this treacherous government that had kept faith with nobody--neither with friend nor with foe.
