The first reference to darkness can be seen at the beginning of the play when Oedipus says “I must bring what is dark to light” which refers to him finding the murderer of Laius. This is also the first representation of darkness as lack of knowledge because Oedipus does not know that he himself is the true murderer of Laius. Further in the play, Oedipus sends Creon, his brother in law, to call for the blind seer of Thebes, Teiresias. At this point in the play, Sophocles refers to darkness in the form of physical blindness. Sophocles portrays both, Oedipus  and Teiresias as people who live in darkness. One who is blind to the truth and the other who is blind to the world. Teiresias himself compares his blindness to that of Oedipus’ when he says “but I say that you, with both your eyes, are blind”. He also asserts “You do not even know the blind wrongs you have done”, which refers to how Oedipus does not have the knowledge of his own past. He does not know that he is the son of Laius and Jocasta who is prophesied to kill his father and marry his mother.
