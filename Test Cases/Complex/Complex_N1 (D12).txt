Almost all of Shakespeare’s Hamlet can be understood as a play about acting and the theatre. For example, in Act 1, Hamlet pretends to be insane in order to make sure his enemies do not discover his mission to revenge his father’s murder. The theme is even more obvious when Hamlet compares the pictures of his mother’s two husbands to show her what a bad choice she has made, using their images to reveal the truth. Also, when he jumps into Ophelia’s grave, hurling his challenge to Laertes, Hamlet demonstrates the foolishness of exaggerated expressions of emotion.

Disobedient and loud students should be separated in a group and taught separately beacause they can interrupt other students. Various schools have adopted this strategy to teach their pupils by separating them on the basis of their behaviour. I will discuss merits and demerits of groupism and present my opinion before I reach the conclusion.
